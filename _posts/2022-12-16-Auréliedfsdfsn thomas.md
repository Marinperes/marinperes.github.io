HEY ✦

I’M AURÉLIEN, I SPECIALIZE IN MOTION DESIGN, 3D & ART DIRECTION, WITH A FOCUS ON BRAND FILMS AND ENVIRONMENT DESIGN.

I ALSO DO GRAPHIC, INTERACTIVE, AND WEBDESIGN

MY GOAL IS TO COLLABORATE WITH CLIENTS ON FILMS & PROJECTS THAT GO BEYOND LOOKING COOL.

I LIKE SOLVING PROBLEMS USING DESIGN AND MOVING IMAGES OR BY COLLABORATING WITH PEOPLE IN OTHER DESIGN FIELDS.

I ALSO DO PHOTOGRAPHY AND TEACHING ON THE SIDE.
